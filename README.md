# Trivia-game
Networking protocol building, Sockets, and a little bit of Json, mainly low-level programming.
Notes:
1. If you want to run it make sure the IP adress is set to local host in the server and client files.
2. First run the server then the clients.
3. The game can handle a number of clients so if you want to share the game with your family just run client agin on a diffrent computer.
4. I was building it mainly to learn how sockets and protocols work.
5. Used python for everything.
6. json was used only to load random questions to the code.
7. If you have any random tips of how to improve the code write below.
